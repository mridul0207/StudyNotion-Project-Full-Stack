# StudyNotion-Project-Full-Stack
This is a full stack project created for teachers as well as students. In frontend, I have used React and React-Redux. And In Backend part, I have used NodeJS,ExpressJS and MongoDB. This is an educational platform on which Teachers can upload their lectures and students will have the access to those courses if they pay.
